## CRITICAL TRUTHS

> _"You won't feel like doing this every day. Do it anyway."_
> **Day 10**: Resistance peaks → _This is where quitters quit. You stay._  
> **Day 21**: The shift hits → _You'll feel lighter, clearer, capable._
> **Miss 2 days straight?** Reset the counter. Not punishment—_integrity_.  
> **Day 28**: This isn't an end. It's PROOF you can do hard things.
