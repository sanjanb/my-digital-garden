# Direction Over Intensity: The Energy-State Theory for Life

Whenever you see this post, remember:

## 1. Direction Beats Intensity
- Where you apply your energy matters more than how much energy you apply.
- Being first or right on the most impactful task is more important than being perfect on everything else.

## 2. Find Your "Wall of Gold"
- Before working hard, make sure you’re working on the right thing.
- Don’t mistake busyness for progress. Identify the wall that actually has the gold behind it.

## 3. Protect Your Peak Energy
- Your best energy is in the morning—use it for your most important work.
- Don’t waste your high-energy state on low-value tasks (like social media or email).
- Aim to finish your most important work by 11:00 AM.

## 4. Prioritize for Impact
- Wake up early and write down your tasks.
- Pick the 1-2 tasks that will change your life in 2-3 years.
- Work on your #1 priority until you’re spent.

## 5. Avoid "Ghost Planets"
- Regularly check if you’re still working on the right goals.
- Don’t be stubborn about a direction that no longer matters.

## 6. Remember These Points
- There are only a few decisions that truly move the needle—find and focus on them.
- Speed and timing often beat quality.
- Use your highest energy for your highest-stakes work.
- Don’t get lost in daily routines and miss big opportunities.
