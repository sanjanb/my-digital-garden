# Rituals

This is a collection of rituals and daily practices that I've integrated into my life. These habits help maintain consistency and build sustainable routines.

## Move Your Body Every Day

- [[move your body every day]]
- Daily physical movement for health and productivity
- Consistency over intensity in building the habit

## Mental Rehearsal Practice

- [[mental-rehearsal-architecture]]
- Regular visualization and mental practice sessions
- Building cognitive frameworks through structured imagination

## Interconnections

These rituals form a foundation for daily well-being:

- **Physical Movement** provides the energy and health foundation.
- **Mental Rehearsal** enhances focus and prepares the mind for challenges.

Together, they create a balanced routine that supports both physical and mental development.
