## **YOUR 2026 TRANSFORMATION WEEKEND**

_One weekend to design a year you won't recognize by December_

---

#### **FRIDAY NIGHT | The Unload (90 min)**

_Free your mind. Capture everything._  
→ Timer on. Pen to paper. No filtering.  
Write every aspiration weighing on you:  
✓ Career moves you've delayed  
✓ Relationships needing repair  
✓ Skills you keep postponing  
✓ Financial targets that intimidate you  
✓ Experiences you keep "someday-ing"  
_Your brain isn't a storage device—it's a processor. Offload the weight._

---

#### **SATURDAY MORNING | The Filter (60 min)**

_Clarity beats volume._  
→ Circle the **3 items** that would genuinely transform your life if achieved.  
→ Everything else becomes "bonus territory"—pursue only after these 3 are moving.  
→ For each of your 3: Define **ONE concrete first step** (e.g., "Email Sarah about mentorship" not "Get promoted").

---

#### **SATURDAY AFTERNOON | The Architecture (90 min)**

_Time-block your non-negotiables FIRST:_  
| Category | Weekly Commitment |  
|----------|-------------------|  
| Sleep | 7–8 hrs/night (block bedtime) |  
| Movement | 30 min × 4 days (schedule like meetings) |  
| Nourishment | 5+ real meals/week (prep Sunday) |  
| **Goal 1** | 5 hrs (e.g., Tue/Thu 7–9pm) |  
| **Goal 2** | 5 hrs (e.g., Sat AM blocks) |  
| **Goal 3** | 3 hrs (e.g., 30 min daily) |  
→ _You have 168 hrs/week. Protecting 25 hrs for growth leaves 143 for life. Stop trading priorities for urgency._

---

#### **SATURDAY EVENING | Systems > Willpower (30 min)**

_Design environments where discipline is effortless:_  
→ Reading goal? Book on pillow each morning.  
→ Saving goal? Auto-transfer $X before payday hits your account.  
→ Connection goal? Monday 9am calendar alert: "Text 1 person who inspires you."  
_Make the right action the path of least resistance._

---

#### **SUNDAY | The Rhythm (60 min total)**

**A. Weekly Review Template** _(20 min every Sunday)_  
✓ What moved my 3 goals forward?  
✓ What drained time without return?  
✓ What's my ONE priority for Monday?

**B. Identity Script** _(5 min)_  
Write 3 present-tense declarations:  
_"I am someone who **\_\_**."_  
Read aloud each morning for 30 seconds.  
_(Your behavior follows your self-concept—not the reverse.)_

**C. Sunday Reset Ritual** _(15 min @ 7pm)_  
→ 5 min: What surprised me this week?  
→ 5 min: One thing I'd adjust next week?  
→ 5 min: My single focus for Monday?  
_Set a recurring alarm: "Sunday Reset – 7pm"_

---

### **THE SHIFT**

You don't lack discipline—you lack architecture.  
Motivation fades. Systems endure.  
This weekend isn't about _trying harder_—it's about **building the structure where progress becomes automatic**.

→ **Block 5 hours this weekend.**  
→ **Tell one person your plan** (accountability = 42% higher success rate).  
→ **Start before you feel "ready."** Ready is a myth manufactured by fear.

_2026 is already unfolding. Design it—or drift through it._

### ✦ SINGLE-PAGE TIPS ✦

- **Font**: Use a clean sans-serif (e.g., Inter, Helvetica) at 10–11pt
- **Layout**: Two-column format saves space while keeping scannable
- **Print**: Fits standard letter/A4 with 0.75" margins
- **Digital**: Save as PDF—set phone wallpaper to "3 Goals" section

_Adapted from mindset frameworks for intentional living. Own your system—own your year._
