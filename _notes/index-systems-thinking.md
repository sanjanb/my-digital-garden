# Systems Thinking Index

Exploring how systems work, evolve, and interact across different scales.

## Key Concepts

- [[Adaptive Patterns]] - How patterns emerge and evolve in systems
- [[Conceptual Frameworks]] - Mental models for understanding complexity
- [[Paradox of Boundaries]] - How boundaries shape and constrain systems
- [[Trust Architecture]] - How structural separation creates reliable systems
- [[Temporal Horizons and Risk]] - How time transforms risk and strategy
- [[Behavioral Inertia]] - Why crowds move as one and consistently fail

## Cross-Domain Applications

- **Software Systems**: [[Programming Concepts]]
- **Personal Development**: [[Career Development]]
- **Daily Practice**: [[Move Your Body Every Day]]

## Current Questions

- How do simple rules generate complex behaviors?
- What makes some systems more resilient than others?
- How do we design systems that adapt gracefully to change?
