# Hello! This is Sanjan's First Personal Note

Welcome to my digital garden! This is where I'll be documenting my journey of learning, growing, and connecting ideas.

## What to expect here

This garden will grow to include:

### Learning & Knowledge

- Notes from books I'm reading
- Insights from courses and tutorials
- Technical concepts and explanations
- [[Programming concepts]] and best practices

### Professional Growth

- [[Career development]] thoughts
- Project retrospectives
- Skills I'm developing
- Industry insights

### Personal Development

- Goal setting and tracking
- [[Productivity systems]] that work for me
- Health and wellness observations
- [[Life lessons]] and reflections

### Technical Interests

- Programming languages and frameworks
- [[Software architecture]] patterns
- Development tools and workflows
- Tech industry trends

## How I'll use this garden

This isn't just a collection of notes - it's a **thinking space** where ideas can:

- **Connect** to each other through bidirectional links
- **Evolve** over time as I learn more
- **Branch** into new areas of exploration
- **Emerge** into unexpected insights

## Current focus areas

Right now, I'm particularly interested in:

- [ ] Setting up my personal knowledge management system
- [ ] Documenting my learning process
- [ ] Building connections between different concepts
- [ ] Sharing insights that might help others
