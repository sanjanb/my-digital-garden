## How I'll use this garden

This isn't just a collection of notes - it's a **thinking space** where ideas can:

- **Connect** to each other through bidirectional links
- **Evolve** over time as I learn more
- **Branch** into new areas of exploration
- **Emerge** into unexpected insights

## Current focus areas

Right now, I'm particularly interested in:
- [ ] Setting up my personal knowledge management system
