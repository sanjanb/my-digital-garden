# My Theories

This is a collection of theories and concepts that I've explored and integrated into my life. These ideas help shape my thinking and decision-making.

## Energy State Theory

- [[energy-state-theory]]
- Focus on direction over intensity
- Prioritize peak energy for high-impact tasks
- Regularly audit goals to avoid "ghost planets"

## Architecture of Discipline

- [[architecture-of-discipline]]
- Building sustainable habits through structured systems
- The foundation for long-term personal growth

## Mental Rehearsal as Cognitive Architecture

- [[mental-rehearsal-architecture]]
- Using visualization and mental practice to build cognitive frameworks
- Preparing the mind for success through structured imagination

## Interconnections

These theories form a cohesive system for personal development:

- **Energy State Theory** provides the strategic focus and timing for efforts.
- **Architecture of Discipline** offers the structural habits to sustain that focus over time.
- **Mental Rehearsal as Cognitive Architecture** enhances both by building mental resilience and clarity through visualization, ensuring that discipline and energy are directed toward well-rehearsed goals.

Together, they create a feedback loop: rehearse mentally, apply disciplined energy strategically, and refine through ongoing audits.
