# Move Your Body Every Day

Move your body every day. Benefits include:

- Improved sleep quality
- Less risk of chronic disease
- Increased productivity
- Reduced anxiety

The "every day" part is important, because [[consistency]] is key to most things worth doing.

## Foundation and Practice

Daily movement need not be complex. The principle is consistency over intensity. Whether it's a walk, stretching, or deliberate strength work, the commitment to daily practice builds the habit architecture.

For those seeking a structured approach to building physical capacity, see [[Strength as Foundation]] for a minimal, efficient protocol.
