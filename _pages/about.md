# About This Digital Garden

Welcome to my personal knowledge garden—a space where ideas grow, connect, and evolve over time.

## Who I Am

I'm Sanjan, a learner and builder exploring the intersections of:

- **Software Engineering** and system design
- **Conceptual Frameworks** that help us understand complexity
- **Personal Development** and sustainable practices
- **Systems Thinking** and emergent behaviors

This digital garden is my workshop for thinking in public, connecting disparate ideas, and building understanding incrementally.

## The Philosophy

Unlike traditional blogs with polished, time-stamped posts, this garden embraces:

- **Growth over perfection** - Notes evolve as I learn more
- **Connection over isolation** - Ideas link to create unexpected insights
- **Process over product** - Half-formed thoughts have value too
- **Exploration over certainty** - Questions are as valuable as answers

## What You'll Find Here

- [[Programming Concepts]] and technical explorations
- [[Conceptual Frameworks]] for understanding systems
- [[Career Development]] insights and strategies
- [[Adaptive Patterns]] across different domains
- Personal experiments and observations

## How to Navigate

- **Start at [[The Threshold]]** for an introduction to my current thinking
- **Browse [[Current Investigations]]** to see what I'm actively exploring
- **Use the graph** at the bottom of each page to visualize connections
- **Follow bidirectional links** (in purple) between related concepts
- **Hover over links** for instant previews without leaving the page

## Get in Touch

This is a public learning space. If something here resonates, challenges, or confuses you, I'd love to hear about it.
