# About Me

Hi! I'm **Sanjan** 👋

Welcome to my digital garden - a space where I cultivate my thoughts, ideas, and learnings. This is where I:

- 📚 **Document my learning journey** across various topics
- 🔗 **Connect ideas** and explore how they relate to each other
- 🌱 **Grow my knowledge** through writing and reflection
- 💡 **Share insights** that might be useful to others

## What you'll find here

This garden contains my notes on:

- Technology and programming
- Books and articles I'm reading
- Personal development insights
- Project documentation
- Random thoughts and observations

## How to navigate

- Use the **graph visualization** at the bottom of each note to explore connections
- Follow the **bidirectional links** (highlighted in purple) between related topics
- Check out the **recent updates** on the homepage
- Hover over links for quick previews

Feel free to explore and discover unexpected connections! �
