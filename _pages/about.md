# The Curator

I am someone who thinks by writing, learns by connecting, and understands through synthesis.

This archive exists because certain ideas refuse to stay contained within traditional boundaries. What you find here represents an ongoing attempt to map the territories where different fields of knowledge meet and influence each other.

- 📚 **Document my learning journey** across various topics
- 🔗 **Connect ideas** and explore how they relate to each other
- 🌱 **Grow my knowledge** through writing and reflection
- 💡 **Share insights** that might be useful to others

## What you'll find here

This garden contains my notes on:

- Technology and programming
- Books and articles I'm reading
- Personal development insights
- Project documentation
- Random thoughts and observations

## How to navigate

- Use the **graph visualization** at the bottom of each note to explore connections
- Follow the **bidirectional links** (highlighted in purple) between related topics
- Check out the **recent updates** on the homepage
- Hover over links for quick previews

Feel free to explore and discover unexpected connections! �
