# Archive Map

A systematic navigation of all thoughts and connections in this codex.

## Conceptual Territories

### **Foundational Frameworks**

- [[Conceptual Frameworks]] — Mental models as infrastructure
- [[The Paradox of Boundaries]] — How constraints enable creativity
- [[Adaptive Patterns]] — Systems that change while maintaining identity

### **Knowledge Transfer**

- [[Conceptual Migration]] — Ideas moving between domains
- Cross-pollination between disciplines
- Pattern recognition across scales

### **Technical Foundations**

- [[Programming concepts]] — Code as crystallized thought
- [[Career development]] — Professional evolution as adaptive process
- Software architecture and system design

### **Original Template Notes**

- [[Your first note]] — Getting started guide
- [[A note about cats]] — Example content and linking
- [[Consistency is key]] — Simple connection demonstration

## Connection Density

**Highly Connected Nodes:**

- The Threshold (hub for new visitors)
- Programming concepts (technical foundation)
- Adaptive Patterns (cross-domain principle)

**Emerging Clusters:**

- Philosophy ↔ Technology bridge
- Abstract concepts ↔ Practical applications
- Personal development ↔ System thinking

## Exploration Strategies

**For the Systematic:** Start with [[Conceptual Frameworks]] and work through the logical connections.

**For the Curious:** Begin anywhere and follow the associative links wherever they lead.

**For the Practical:** Focus on [[Programming concepts]] and [[Career development]] for actionable insights.

**For the Philosophical:** Explore [[The Paradox of Boundaries]] and its connections to constraint-based creativity.
