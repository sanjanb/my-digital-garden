# Start Here 👋

Welcome to my digital garden! If you're new, this guide will help you navigate and get the most from exploring this space.

## What is This Place?

This is a **digital garden**—not a blog. Think of it as:

- 🌱 A growing collection of ideas, notes, and connections
- 🔗 An interconnected web of thoughts (not chronological posts)
- 🚧 A space where notes evolve and improve over time
- 🧪 An experiment in learning and thinking in public

Unlike traditional blogs with polished, finished articles, gardens grow organically. Some notes are seedlings (rough ideas), others are well-established plants (refined concepts).

## How to Explore

## Understanding Note States

Notes exist in different stages of development:

## Philosophy

This garden embraces:

- **Imperfection** - Notes don't need to be "done" to be shared
- **Growth** - Ideas evolve, expand, and occasionally wither
- **Connection** - Understanding emerges through relationships
- **Transparency** - The thinking process is as valuable as conclusions
