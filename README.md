# Sanjan's Codex 🌱

A digital garden exploring the architecture of thought, behavior, and systems through interconnected philosophical notes.

## About This Garden

**Sanjan's Codex** is a living collection of ideas that grow through connection and reflection. Rather than presenting finished conclusions, this space embraces the process of thinking itself—where notes evolve, concepts interweave, and understanding deepens over time.

### What You'll Find Here

The garden is organized around three core domains:

**Systems Thinking & Architecture**  
Explorations of how patterns emerge across scales—from trust structures in financial systems to the behavioral dynamics of crowds. Notes examine principles like asymmetry, temporal horizons, and the invisible foundations that enable exponential growth.

**Personal Development & Mental Training**  
Investigations into the cognitive infrastructure of performance and growth. Topics include mental rehearsal as neural architecture, the compound effects of consistency, strength training as system design, and practices for bridging present action with future intention.

**Current Investigations**  
Active areas of inquiry where new patterns are emerging. These notes represent works-in-progress, exploring questions about cognitive architecture, behavioral design, and the structural principles that create reliable outcomes.

### Philosophy of the Garden

This is not a blog. There are no publication dates, no chronological archives, no pressure for polished perfection. Instead, this garden operates by different principles:

- **Growth over completion** — Notes improve incrementally as understanding deepens
- **Connection over categorization** — Ideas link naturally, creating emergent insights
- **Process over product** — The evolution of thought has intrinsic value
- **Questions over certainty** — Curiosity drives exploration

### Navigation

The garden uses **bidirectional linking** to create a web of connected ideas. Click any `[[bracketed link]]` to follow a thread of thought. The **graph visualization** reveals the network structure of concepts, showing how ideas relate and cluster.
