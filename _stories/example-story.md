# Example Story Template

This is a template to guide your storytelling. Delete this file and create your own stories in the `_stories/` folder.

## The Situation

Set the scene. What was happening? What context matters?

Keep it specific:

- When did this occur? (doesn't need exact dates, but "early in my career" vs. "after a decade of experience" matters)
- What were the circumstances?
- What was at stake?

## The Response

What did you actually do? Include the messy details:

- Initial instinct vs. considered response
- What influenced the decision
- What you didn't do (and why)

Avoid retrospective wisdom. Capture what you knew and believed at the time.

## The Pattern

Looking back, what does this reveal?

This is where the story connects to concepts:

- What principle was at play?
- How does this instance illuminate a broader pattern?
- What would you recognize faster if you encountered it again?

Link to relevant notes: [[Conceptual Frameworks]], [[Adaptive Patterns]], etc.

## The Question

What remains unresolved? What would you handle differently now? What are you still unsure about?

The best stories don't resolve cleanly. They leave productive uncertainty.

## Writing Your Own Stories

1. Create a new `.md` file in the `_stories/` folder
2. Use this frontmatter format:

```yaml
---
title: Your Story Title
date: YYYY-MM-DD
tags: [tag1, tag2, tag3]
---
```

3. Follow the structure above (or create your own)
4. Stories will automatically appear on the Stories index page

Delete this example when you're ready to add your first real story.
