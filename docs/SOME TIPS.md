In this video, **Shri Hit Premanand Ji Maharaj** outlines eight powerful principles for spiritual growth and self-improvement. He emphasizes that if a person truly wants to progress on the spiritual path, they must adhere to these disciplines to avoid mental and spiritual downfall.

### **The 8 Powerful Tips for Self-Improvement**

1. **Accept the Discipline of a Saint (Guru):**
* One must have a spiritual guide or saint whose discipline and instructions are followed strictly. Without a "master" to check your ego and actions, the mind is prone to delusion and hypocrisy [[01:57](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT-zg2NPB7Y&t=117)].
* True progress happens when a realized master validates your path, not when you declare yourself successful [[03:33](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT-zg2NPB7Y&t=213)].


2. **Avoid Friendship with Worldly People:**
* A serious practitioner should avoid intimate socializing or "sangoshthi" with those driven by worldly desires. Their materialistic tendencies can be distracting and attractive to the senses, leading one away from God [[12:18](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT-zg2NPB7Y&t=738)].
* Engaging too deeply with worldly people may lead them to praise you as an avatar or god, which feeds the ego and disconnects you from the true Divine [[13:08](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT-zg2NPB7Y&t=788)].


3. **Endure Criticism and Insults:**
* When others criticize or insult you, do not retaliate. Instead, pray for their well-being. This tolerance is a sign of spiritual maturity and helps you rise above the ego [[16:59](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT-zg2NPB7Y&t=1019)].
* Maharaj suggests that when you are criticized, think that God is using this to make you great [[14:41](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT-zg2NPB7Y&t=881)].


4. **Never Criticize Others:**
* One should never personally criticize or speak ill of anyone by name. While one may speak against false ideologies or hypocrisy in principle, personal slander must be strictly avoided [[17:37](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT-zg2NPB7Y&t=1057)].


5. **Give Respect to Everyone and Seek None for Yourself:**
* Abandon the desire for respect and recognition. Instead, make it a habit to offer respect to everyone, from a small child to an elder, seeing the Divine in all [[18:19](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT-zg2NPB7Y&t=1099)].


6. **Maintain Ethical Conduct and Sense Control (Indriya Nigrah):**
* A practitioner must keep their senses and mind under control, following the injunctions of the scriptures. Without pure conduct (Sadachar), spiritual practice is mere drama or a "facade" [[20:15](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT-zg2NPB7Y&t=1215)].
* He warns that slipping in conduct leads to inner misery, where one might start hating their own life or body [[23:04](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT-zg2NPB7Y&t=1384)].


7. **Do Not Accept Positions or Titles:**
* A true seeker should never accept social titles, positions, or honors, as these act as "upadhis" (limiting adjuncts) that create disturbances and fuel pride [[26:43](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT-zg2NPB7Y&t=1603)].
* By remaining title-less and humble, one attains the highest spiritual state where even God follows the seeker [[27:58](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT-zg2NPB7Y&t=1678)].


8. **Constant Remembrance of the Divine (Aradhya Dev):**
* In every circumstance—favorable or unfavorable—never let the remembrance (Chintan) of your goal or deity slip from your mind. This is the ultimate fruition of the spiritual path [[29:44](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT-zg2NPB7Y&t=1784)].



### **Key Takeaway**

Maharaj concludes that the first point (discipline under a master) and the final point (constant remembrance) are the most crucial. If these are maintained, all other virtues will naturally follow [[30:09](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT-zg2NPB7Y&t=1809)].
